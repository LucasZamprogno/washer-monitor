# washer-monitor
This was an attempt at using a Raspberry Pi along with vibration sensors to create an app to monitor if our laundry machines are running or available (our laundry is both shared, and outside, so it sucks when you put on your shoes to go out in winter and find out it's running).

Abandoned after the vibration sensors were just not sensitive enough to pick up movement reliably, and getting wires of the correct length proved to be a challenge without significant soldering effort. The idea and code worked at least.
